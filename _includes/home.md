BuildingSync<sup>&reg;</sup> is a common schema for energy audit data that can be utilized by different software and databases involved in the energy audit process. It allows data to be more easily aggregated, compared, and exchanged between different databases and software tools. This streamlines the energy audit process, improving the value of the data, minimizing duplication of effort for subsequent audits, and facilitating achievement of greater energy efficiency.

BuildingSync was developed to address the lack of an industry-standard collection format for energy audit data.  Standardizing energy audit data can help energy auditors, software providers, building owners, utilities, and other entities by maximizing the value that can be obtained from each set of data - value obtained through collaboration, comparison, and reuse.

The schema was developed by a [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](http://www.nrel.gov/) led working group. Working group participants included [industry partners, national laboratories, and industry organizations](about/collaborators/).

BuildingSync standardizes the format of the energy audit data itself.  It is not intended to standardize the calculations performed on these data by engineers, analysts, software packages, or other audit tools.
