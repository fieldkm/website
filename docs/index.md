The first three documents (Data Dictionary, Geometry Reference Sheet) comprise BuildingSync, and the fourth (Implementation Guide) is a comprehensive guide to using it and implementing it with energy auditing software.

#### [Data Dictionary](BuildingSync%20Data%20Dictionary%202.0.xlsx)
The [data field "dictionary"](BuildingSync%20Data%20Dictionary%202.0.xlsx) is in Excel format, including field names, definitions, units, and other attributes. The data dictionary is aligned with BEDES, but includes only the subset of data fields that are relevant for energy audits. This file can be referenced to help standardize the terminology used in energy audits, but does it does not provide a structure that allows data to be exchanged across different applications.

#### [Example Files](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/tree/develop/examples)
These [example files](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/tree/develop/examples) aid in applying the schema to a particular energy auditing software. This collection is not exhaustive, but should still be helpful.

#### [Geometry Reference Sheet](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/blob/develop/docs/Geometry%20Reference.pdf)
The BuildingSync [Geometry Reference Sheet](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/blob/develop/docs/Geometry%20Reference.pdf) illustrates how most of the simplified geometric terms (shapes, side names, vertices, orientations) are defined in the context of BuildingSync.

#### [Implementation Guide](BuildingSync%20v1.0-legacy%20Implementation%20Guide.pdf)
The [Implementation Guide](BuildingSync%20v1.0-legacy%20Implementation%20Guide.pdf) is a comprehensive guide illustrating the process needed to adopt the Building Sync schema. The Guide also provides context for Building Sync and discusses how it has been developed in close coordination with the energy auditing industry.
